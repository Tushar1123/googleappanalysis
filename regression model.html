        <h1>Regression Model</h1>
      <p>  To predict the ratings of the App (before/after launching it on Play Store).
This is clearly a regression problem.</p>

<h3>•	Let’s start with importing libraries and reading required csv file</h3>

<h3>•	Data Cleaning :</h3>
<p>The most critical thing from which patterns could be obtained is data. It may be a single review or a bundle of them.
   Whatever data comes in, could be used to draw value out of it. Data comes with unexpected values too, which should be handled
   before it affects the performance of trained models that predict the outcome.</p><br><br>

<p>Here is the first step to clean the data that will make the results “more” accurate.</p>

<h3>•	Data transformation</h3>

<p>Data transformation is the process of changing the format, structure, or values of data i.e converting data from one format
   or structure into another format or structure. Data transformation may be constructive (adding, copying, and replicating data),
    destructive (deleting fields and records), aesthetic (standardizing salutations or street names), or structural (renaming, moving,
    and combining columns in a database).In this particular dataset, we have also transformed several columns i.e. ‘Category’ , ‘Type’
    , ‘Content Rating’, ‘Android Version’, ‘App’, ‘Installs’, ‘Size’, ‘Price’, ‘Review’. After transforming the data into the required format,
     we can drop the entries(or the columns) which are no longer required.</p>

<h3>•	Model Building</h3>
<p>
For this particular “googleplaystore.csv” dataset, the Linear Regression model has been used for predicting the Ratings.
This dataset has been trained on a Multi-Linear Regression Model.</p><br><br>
<p>Steps carried out for building a Linear Regression Model in the assignment are as follows:<p>

<h4>Step I: Deciding X and Y</h4>
<p>For our Linear Regression Model, 'y' would be the output that we expect our model to give that is the Rating. Hence,
  we create a Series which contains the 'Rating' column of the dataset and 'x' would be the input or the features on which
  the ratings of the application would depend. Hence, we create a Series which contains all the relevant features' column of the dataset.
</p>
<h4>Step II: Splitting the dataset into Train and Test Datasets</h4>

<p>After deciding our x and y for the model, the next step is to divide the dataset into train and test datasets.<br>
1.	Train dataset- The actual dataset that we use to train the model .The model sees and learns from this data.<br>
2.	Test dataset- The test set is a set of observations used to evaluate the performance of the model using some performance metric. <br>
The sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training dataset.<br>
We divide the dataset into train and set tests using the sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split(*arrays, options*) method.<br>


For this assignment we split the dataset into train and test datasets in the ratio 4:1 that is:<br>
80% - TRAINING DATASET <br>

20% - TESTING DATASET <br>
</p>
<h4>Step III.</h4>
<p>The next step is to actually construct a Linear Regression model which would predict the Ratings of the application
   depending upon some features. We build the Linear Regression model using :<br>
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression <br>
reg=LinearRegression() <br>
This creates a Linear Regression model with an object(i.e an instance) ‘reg’ <br>
</p>
<h4>Step IV.</h4>
<p>After initializing the model, we need to train the model so as to make the model learn about how to predict the ratings.
We implement this using reg.fit(x,y,[,sample weight]) method which basically fits the linear model. In this method we give an
input of the training sets(x_train,y_train) which we have created earlier.
</p>
<h4>Step V.</h4>
<p>The next important step to check the accuracy score of the model which tells about how correct or accuarte our model is
  on predicting the Ratings. This is implemented using the reg.score(x,y,[,sample weight]) method which takes an input as the
  test sets(x_test,y_test) which were created earlier.</p>

<h4>Step VI. </h4>
<p>Our model is now ready to predict the Ratings of various applications given some features.</p>
